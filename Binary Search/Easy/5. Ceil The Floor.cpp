/*
Given a sorted array arr[] of size N without duplicates, and given a value x. 
Floor of x is defined as the largest element K in arr[] such that K is smaller than or equal to x.
Find the index of K(0-based indexing).

Ceil of X is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to X. Ceil of X doesnâ€™t exist if X is greater than greatest element of Arr[].


Input:
N = 6, x = 8 
arr[] = {3 4 4 7 8 10}
Output: 8 8
Since x = 8 is present in the array, it will be both floor and ceiling.

6 2
3 4 4 7 8 10
ans = -1 3
Since no number is less than or equal to x = 2 in the array, its floor does not exist. The ceiling will be 3.
